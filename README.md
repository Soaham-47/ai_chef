# 👨‍🍳 Chef Claude - AI Recipe Generator

Chef Claude is a full-stack application that helps users decide what to cook based on the ingredients they already have. The app features a modern React frontend and a secure Express.js backend that interfaces with the Hugging Face Inference API to generate creative recipes.

## 🚀 Features
- **Smart Pantry:** Add and manage a list of ingredients in real-time.
- **AI-Generated Recipes:** Get custom recipes from Large Language Models (LLMs) once you have at least 4 ingredients.
- **Secure Architecture:** API keys are stored on the server side to prevent exposure in the browser.
- **Markdown Support:** Recipes are beautifully formatted using `react-markdown`.
- **Fast Development:** Built with Vite for instant Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
